# FakeMT
ðŸ’¼This project brings a lot of new additions to my Minecraft Server. The complete project consists of Java and is self-made.

I started this project to help myself to make certain things easier.
The code contains some intelligence and things that make it much easier for me as a server developer.

Everything is made by me and is therefore not allowed to claim that these items are made by you
If this is done, the guidelines will be shit and there will be later penalties.
