# FakeMT Extra Features
ðŸ’¼This project brings a lot of new additions to my Minecraft Server. The complete project consists of Java and is self-made.

I started this project to help myself to make certain things easier.
The code contains some intelligence and things that make it much easier for me as a server developer.

Everything is made by me and is therefore not allowed to claim that these items are made by you

## What is this plugin for?
I made the plugin a while ago to make certain roleplay functions on my server more fun. The plugin also added a number of useful things that made it easier as an administrator to manage the server.

## What does this plugin include?
The plugin has a lot of nice features for your server. They are listed below:
- Alert command - Made to broadcast a message easily
- A bottle stacker - This is for stacking bottles in the game. !Only possible in survival!
- Control stats - A feature to crouch and then click on someone to view their stats.
- Fast item edit - Made to easily edit the data of an item. So you can adjust displayname, lore and more with 1 command
- Links command - Command to receive the links and socials from the server
- Custom death message - The function says it all
- Shairs - Created to give the player the option to sit on a bib or stair.
- Vaults - Vaults allow players to store their belongings in a vault. The owner can easily create a vault with 1 command and add players to it.
- Pets - An option to give the players pets. Players are able to get a pet. (Not too well elaborated!)
- AutoEnchant - Random enchant all the items in the player's inventory
- AutoLore - Give all the items in the player's inventory their own lore
- AutoKit - When spawning, give the player a kit of their own composed by the admin
- AutoRemover - Function to kick someone automatically every time they join. That's how you get rid of someone :D. You can also just ban.
- Armorstand editor - Allows you to customize an armorstand. This way you can adjust the position of the armor stand together with his clothing.

## What version is the plugin for?
The plugin is made for servers running on spigot 1.12.2. This was done because the features that the plugin added were an addition to another plugin that also worked on 1.12.2.

## Is the plugin active?
No, development for this plugin has been stopped as the server no longer exists.
